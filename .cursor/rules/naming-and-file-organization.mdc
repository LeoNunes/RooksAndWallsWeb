# Naming & File Organization

## Name things after their architectural role, not current implementation

A component named after what it *looks like today* will become misleading as the UI evolves. Name after what the thing *does*.

```
// ❌ BAD — tied to current visual form
PlayerSidebar, InfoPanel, BottomBar

// ✅ GOOD — describes the role
GameFrame      (wraps content with contextual game info)
GameResult     (represents the outcome of a game)
```

## When a file handles multiple concerns, split it

If a file contains an orchestrator, a controller, and business logic, break it into separate files — one per responsibility.
